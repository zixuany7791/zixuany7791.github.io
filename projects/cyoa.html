            <p></p>
            <p>Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) Project is a little game where you decide which way you want to go with different scenario. Each decision you make will lead to a different scenario and will affect how the ending will be. In order to make this game possible, we need to use what we learned about github, html/css or markdown to create our CYOA project.</p>
            <p>We chose World War 1 as background setting in our adventure. The adventure begins when the character wakes up and receives a letter from the military to join military to fight for US. He can either try escape from the military or trying to fight for the country.</p>
            <p>I think the biggest challenge I have faced for this project is try to organize the files because even though I named every file differently, it can be everywhere which it takes me a while to find which files is the file I want to link to or which one is the file that I want to edit. Therefore what I did is that I organize all the files into two directory, which each directory is a path to one ending or the other. And letting my partner do one part and I do the second directory. I did this to also prevent merge conflict because we are working on the same project but different files but still a lot of merge conflict still happened. My partner was not confident enough to solve merge conflict on his own therefore I have to help him out a little bit. </p>
